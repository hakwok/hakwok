<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hayden</h1>
<h3 align="center">Computer Science @ UC San Diego</h3>

I am a third-year student at the University of California, San Diego, pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My research interests focus on employing adversarial/deceptive planning and strategic obfuscation within reinforcement learning agents. I specialize in harnessing big data, recommender systems, and natural language processing to transform products and software with machine learning.
